# Unity VR Playground

This app is a playground for VR features. In other words: a place for experimentation. The point is to have a go at a feature I'm interested in, even if it doesn't yet fit any project.  

Since copyrighted assets are used, the actual repo has been made private. However, you can download the current build by clicking on the zip file in this repo and then the "Download raw file" button.

NOTE: For certain reasons, I've decided to suddenly move on from Unity. This means that this playground won't be developped further. Nonetheless, it's still available for you to see how I've had progressed since [the VR art gallery](https://github.com/TheLycorisRadiata/unity_app_art-gallery). To that end, I wish I could have showcased more with this project: all that I've had learned with Unity, features that I had the ability to add but not the time to, as well as a tutorial to allow users to be aware of said features. Well, it is what it is, I'll just do all that with Unreal.
