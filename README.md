# VR Playground

This app is a playground for VR features. In other words: a place for experimentation. The point is to have a go at a feature I'm interested in, even if it doesn't yet fit any project.  

Since copyrighted assets are used, the actual repo has been made private. However, you can download the current build on [Itch.io](https://mofumofustudios.itch.io/vr-playground).
